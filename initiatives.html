  <h3>Yale Early-Career Researcher Symposium</h3>
  <p>With Elizabeth Blackmore (EEB) and Yi Ting Chew (YSPH), I am leading a symposium for early-career researchers to present ongoing work with an invited lecture from Dr. Bryan Grenfell. We hope that this grows into a more regional event to serve EEID communities in the region. </p><br>
